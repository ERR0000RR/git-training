     *  1) Create a constructor in this file that prints out "Bob is building..." to the console
     * 2) Commit this change with following commit message "Add constructor to Task3"
     * 3) Create a private method called startBuild() that takes a name of type String as input parameter
     * and should print "<name> is building..." to the console

     * 5) Commit this changes with the message "Add startBuild method"
     * 6) Push all the changes to remote repository
     * 7) Oh no... Bob was not ready for this, let's please Bob by remove this commits with the reset functionality.
